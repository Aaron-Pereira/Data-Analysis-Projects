# Data Analysis Projects

This section showcases data analytics projects I have undertaken, demonstrating my ability to extract insights from data, build visualizations, and apply machine learning techniques. Each project includes a brief outline of the problem statement, methodology, key findings, and any notable technical implementations.

These projects reflect my skills in Python, SQL, Tableau, and other data analysis tools, as well as my ability to work with real-world datasets to drive meaningful conclusions. Whether it's exploratory data analysis (EDA), predictive modeling, or data storytelling, this portfolio highlights my passion for turning raw data into actionable insights.
